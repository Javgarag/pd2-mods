# PD2BanksInfoEditor
Simple CLI program to modify `.banksinfo` files in PAYDAY 2 (and possibly other Diesel games?). The modification of this file allows for custom soundbank loading, as long as they have been created with *Wwise 2013.2*, with support for streamed audio files in these.

This solution uses a fork of DieselEngineFormats which adds writing functionality to BanksInfo; see [here for the repo](https://github.com/Javgarag/DieselEngineFormats).
