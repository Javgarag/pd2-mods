There are two types of supported animations:

* "Long" interactions: these consist of three animations: one for entering the interaction, one for looping during it, and a final one to exit it. This structure accounts for early cancels and AI speed boosts.
* "Instant" interactions: these are a single animation that play on the left arm, while maintaining the weapon animation on the other. Sprinting, meleeing or shooting cancel them.

**You can also use any unit in your animation, and spawn it later**. Animations for deploying equipment are not currently supported, but can be added in a later version of the base mod.

After you've created your animation, it's time to make it available. Revise the following:
*Inside all of the template files, you have every structure you'll need; use common sense to remove anything you don't need for your animation(s). *

* Change the mod name in `mod.txt` and `main.xml`, and add any additional information (contact, author, etc).
* Inside `main.xml`, add the paths to your animations.
	* If your animation makes use of an unit (e.g. a keycard), add those paths too. **However, you need to derive a material config from the unit's original one that uses templates that include `DEPTH_SCALING` for its materials, so it is properly drawn in the game. See the MWS wiki on this file format for more info.**
* Decide on a name for the animation, it needs to be unique enough so it doesn't get used by anything else. Use it consistently inside the following files.
* Inside `scriptdata/animation_states.xml`, in *SECTION #1*, add that name to the `name` value and change the `redirect` value to include that same name at the end. Now, depending on your animation, proceed differently:
	1. If your animation **IS INSTANT**, remove sections *#2, #3, #4, and #5*. In *SECTION #6*, change the redirect to `fps/offhand/interact/{ANIMATION_NAME}` and the animation name to yours.
	2. If your animation **IS OF SEPARATE PARTS**, remove *SECTION #6*. For the rest of the sections:
		* Change the state names so that the last section is your animation name. E.g. `fps/{INTERACT_PART}/{ANIMATION_NAME}`
		* Add your animation name in the `name` attribute, with suffixes `_enter, _hold, _exit` depending on the section; for *SECTION #5*, use `_exit`.
		* In *SECTION #2*, add the name of your `interact_hold` state to the `exit` node's `name` value.  
		* In *SECTION #3*, add the names of your `interact_exit` and `interact_interupt` states to the `to` node's `redirect` value.
* Inside `scriptdata/animation_subset.xml`, point the names you added before to the `anim` nodes (so your animation name, with/without suffixes) to their corresponding files; you should have three for long interactions, and one for instantaneous ones.
* Inside `interaction_animation_tweak_data.lua`, follow the commented instructions.
